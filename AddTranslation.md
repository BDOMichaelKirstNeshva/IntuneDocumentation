# Add translations
When using the parameter UseTranslationBeta the api names will be translated to the labels used in the Intune Portal. 

1. Open the json file
2. Specify the Name and section of each api propert name by copying the labels from the Intune Console. All names have to be in english. If a you cannot associate a property with label, then leave the Name attribute in the json file just empty. 
3. Save the file 
4. Create a new documentation and check if the result is as expected. if no, go back to step 2.
5. Submit your file to the project by creating an issue, send via one of my social media channels or push it to the repo (Whatever is simpler for you).

## Usage

Since version 2.0.0 the Automatic Intune Documentation script is available in th PowerShell Gallery and therefore its much simpler to install and use it. You can just use these two commands:

```powershell

Install-Module IntuneDocumentation
Invoke-IntuneDocumentation -FullDocumentationPath c:\temp\IntuneDoc.docx

```

**Important:** Before using the Script the first time, you have to ensure, that you have installed the Microsoft.Graph.Intune and PSWord Module. To do that, you have to start PowerShell as an Adminstrator and install them:

```powershell

Install-Module Microsoft.Graph.Intune
Install-Module PSWord

```

## Additional Options
 
### UseTranslationBeta
When using this parameter the API names will be translated to the labels used in the Intune Portal. 
Note:
These Translations need to be created manually, only a few are translated yet. If you are willing 
to support this project. You can do this by translating the json files which are mentioned to you when 
you generate the documentation in your tenant. 

```powershell

Invoke-IntuneDocumentation -FullDocumentationPath c:\temp\IntuneDoc.docx -UseTranslationBeta

```
